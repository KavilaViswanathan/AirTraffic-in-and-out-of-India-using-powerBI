## 1. Introduction

The Indian aviation industry has a rich history, witnessing growth in both passenger and freight segments. In the 2017 fiscal year, domestic passenger traffic increased by 21.5%, with scheduled airlines expected to cover longer distances. The number of non-scheduled carriers rose from 39 to 112, and operational airports increased from 50 to 125, of which 90 are functional.

## 1.1 Market Size and Trends

- India ranks ninth in market size according to the 2017 India Brand Equity Survey Report.
- Domestic passengers increased from 85.20 million (2015–16) to 103.75 million (2016–17).
- International passengers rose from 49.78 million (2015–16) to 54.68 million (2016–17).
- The industry transitioned from government dominance to coexistence with private entities, fostering competitiveness.

## 1.2 Data Collection

Data is sourced from the DGCA, collected by the Indian government. The dataset covers international air traffic from January 2015 to March 2017, categorized by airline, city pair, and country.

**Dataset:** [DGCA Monthly Statistics](https://www.dgca.gov.in/digigovportal/?page=monthlyStatistics/259/4751/html&main259/4184/servicename)

## 1.3 Problem Statement

Airport data being seasonal, comparative analyses are conducted on a period-over-period basis. The goal is to identify total freights and passengers moved within India and internationally.

## 1.4 Business Objectives

- Analyze air transport in India.
- Visualize total passengers in domestic and international flights.
- Visualize freight movement across the country.
- Provide insights on airline-wise, country-wise, and city-wise flights.

## 2. Data Processing

### 2.1 Data Cleaning

Correct or remove inaccurate, damaged, or duplicate data from the dataset.

### 2.2 Data Transformation

Convert data into appropriate formats for the mining process, including normalization, attribute selection, discretization, and concept hierarchy level.

### Data Processing

Manipulate data using a computer, involving flow through the CPU and memory, output device formatting, and conversion of raw data to machine-readable form.

## 3. Data Preparation

Organize and process acquired data before analysis, including structuring data into tables for statistical or spreadsheet software.

**Data Sources:** Three Excel files containing air traffic information for the years 2015-2017.

## 4. Data Visualization

The Power BI report focuses on three key aspects:

### 4.1 Airline-wise Analysis

- Visualize the performance and contribution of each airline.
- Analyze trends in passenger and freight movement for each airline.

### 4.2 Country-wise Analysis

- Explore the international traffic to and from India by country.
- Understand the distribution of passengers and freights across different countries.

### 4.3 City Pair-wise Analysis

- Examine specific city pairs to identify high-traffic routes.
- Analyze the correlation between cities in terms of air traffic.

## Getting Started

Explore how to create a Power BI dashboard with the air traffic dataset. Refer to the [PowerBI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/).

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into air traffic in and out of India, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.
